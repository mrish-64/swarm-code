# Swarm algorithms used in the document

In this project, the source code of standard serial swarm algorithms are proposed.
## Local Packages Installed (same as swarm* project)

matplotlib==3.5.3

numpy==1.23.2

> Use `pip install` to install the packages

## HOWTO use


1. we recommend first seeing and using swarm* which is proposed in the sibling project


2. copy the project structure to your HDD


3. most of the settings are the same as the sibling project except run each .py file in its corresponding folder for example `D:\swarm-code\Cuckoo_search\cs.py` (to execute the algorithm only run cs.py)


4. each of the swarm optimizations uses `D:\my_code` (which should be done in step 1)

5. The benchmark functions definition file is the same as the swarm* project and located in the `D:\my_code\functions.py`
